when you run enter line 11, the following happens;
ROS 2 locates the turtlesim package in the ROS 2 workspace.
It finds the turtlesim_node executable within the package.
The turtlesim_node executable is launched, starting the turtlesim node.
The turtlesim node initializes and starts executing its functionality, which typically involves displaying a graphical user interface (GUI) window showing a turtle in a simulated environment.
Users can interact with the turtlesim environment by sending ROS 2 messages to control the turtle's movement, change its color, teleport it to different positions, and more.
